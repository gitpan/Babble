* Babble 0.02 -- 2004-03-09

** Lots of documentation updates.

Documentation was cleared up in many places, and was generally made
better.

** Internal restructuring.

The internal structure of objects was greatly simplified, resulting
in less memory usage and faster operation. Not to mention easier
maintainance.

** Date parsing fixes

The Babble::DataSource modules often failed to parse the dates they
encountered, this was fixed.

** New output method and theme

There is a new output method, Babble::Output::TTk, which uses the
Template Toolkit, and is the preferred output method as of now.

There is a highly customisable theme based on it,
Babble::Theme::planet_ttk. This one provides not only a HTML
template, but FOAF and OPML templates too.

** Test suite

The beginnings of a test suite is included with this release.

* Babble 0.01 -- 2004-03-07
