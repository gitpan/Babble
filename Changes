* Babble 0.03 -- 2004-03-14

** Some internal restructuring.

Implemented a Babble::Transport module, for transparent location
access (currently only used by Babble::DataSource::RSS and
Babble::DataSource::OPML).

** Theme updates and modifications.

The FOAF and OPML formats from planet_ttk were moved to a separate
XML theme, planet_ttk got renamed to planet_grey and received some
layout updates.

** New and improved example script

There is a new and improved example script, that can be used to set
up Babbles with only minimal configuration and no coding. It does not
support all the bells and whistles of Babble, though.

** New, OPML data source

A new DataSource module, Babble::DataSource::OPML was added to the
distribution. It can parse OPML documents, and collect the RSS feeds
mentioned therein.

* Babble 0.02 -- 2004-03-09

** Lots of documentation updates.

Documentation was cleared up in many places, and was generally made
better.

** Internal restructuring.

The internal structure of objects was greatly simplified, resulting
in less memory usage and faster operation. Not to mention easier
maintainance.

** Date parsing fixes

The Babble::DataSource modules often failed to parse the dates they
encountered, this was fixed.

** New output method and theme

There is a new output method, Babble::Output::TTk, which uses the
Template Toolkit, and is the preferred output method as of now.

There is a highly customisable theme based on it,
Babble::Theme::planet_ttk. This one provides not only a HTML
template, but FOAF and OPML templates too.

** Test suite

The beginnings of a test suite is included with this release.

* Babble 0.01 -- 2004-03-07
